Week 2: Programming Assignment 1

Released Monday, May 19th, 2014
Due Monday, June 2nd, 2014

In this second assignment, you'll implement a subset of the
java.util.concurrent.atomic.SimpleAtomicLong class using a Java
ReentrantReadWriteLock.  The goal is to understand how to use
ReentrantReadWriteLock to serialize access to a variable that's shared
by multiple threads.

The BuggyLongTest.java program shows what happens if concurrent access
to a long isn't properly serialized.  This test program works best on
a multi-core/multi-processor machine, which should induce a failure
due to race conditions stemming from parallel execution.  If this test
"succeeds" then your target platform may not be sufficiently parallel
to demonstrate the race conditions.

In the src/edu/vuum/mocca directory you'll find the
SimpleAtomicLong.java class, which contains the skeleton Java code
that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here"
comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL
STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO - You fill in here"
portions!!!

Programming Assignment 0

In this first (intentionally simple) assignment, you will use a Java
ReentrantReadWriteLock to implement a subset of the
java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong class, which we call
SimpleAtomicLock.  The goal is to understand how to use
ReentrantReadWriteLock to serialize access to a variable that's shared
by multiple threads.  The SimpleAtomicLongTest.java program creates
two Threads that increment and decrement the AtomicLong 10,000,000
times each.  If the SimpleAtomicLong implementation is properly
serialized it's final value should be 0.

The BuggyLongTest.java program shows what happens if concurrent access
to a long isn't properly serialized.  This test program works best on
a multi-core/multi-processor machine, which should actually induce
failure due to race conditions stemming from parallel execution.  If
this test "succeeds" then your target platform is not sufficiently
parallel to demonstrate the bug.

In this directory you'll find the SimpleAtomicLong.java class, which
contains the skeleton Java code that you'll implement by completing
the "TODO - You fill in here" comments to provide a working solution.
DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the
"TODO - You fill in here" portions!!!

In particular, you'll need to do the following:

. Implement the SimpleAtomicLong class using a Java
  ReentrantReadWriteLock, which is covered in this video:
  
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 6: Java ReentrantReadWriteLock

  There's also a good tutorial on ReentrantReadWriteLock at
  
  http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-util-concurrent/readwritelock.html

. Make sure to use a readLock() for SimpleAtomicLong.get() and
  writeLock() for all the other SimpleAtomicLong methods.

Note that the SimpleAtomicLongTest.java program uses Java Threads and
Runnables, which are described in these videos:

. The SimpleAtomicLongTest.java program uses various features of Java
  Threads and Runnables, which are described in these videos:

Likewise, it also uses the Java CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier
classes, which are described in this video:

  Section 1: Module 2: Part 9: Java CountDownLatch

When you first open the project in Eclipse, you might see compile
errors if JUnit is not included in your build path.  To fix these
errors, open SynchronizedQueueTest.java, hover over "org.junit," and
click "Fix project setup."  Make sure "Add JUnit 4 library to the
build path" is selected and then click "OK."  At this point, the
compile errors should disappear!

To run the JUnit tests in Eclipse, right-click on
SimpleAtomicLongTests.java and Run As > JUnit Test.  The JUnit view
will pop up in Eclipse and run the the tests, which are divided into
two subsets: multi-threaded and single-threaded tests.  The
single-threaded tests verify functionality of all methods within a
single thread, while the multi-threaded tests do the same in a
multi-threaded environment.  All tests should run successfully, i.e.,
a green-check mark will appear next to the test in the JUnit view.  As
long as this JUnit test "passes" successfully your program will be be
consider "correct" for the purposes of assessing this assignment.

When the 2014 POSA MOOC officially starts these videos will be
available at

https://class.coursera.org/posa-002/lecture

We'll also discuss this assignment specification (and later its
solution) in the POSA MOOC "Virtual Office Hours", which are described
in item #38 at the POSA MOOC FAQ available from

http://www.courera.org/course/posa

To compile this code you can either use the provided Eclipse project
or simply type

% javac SimpleAtomicLockTest.java SimpleAtomicLock.java

on the command-line and then run the resulting class file by typing

% java SimpleAtomicLockTest

The output for a correct solution should look exactly like this:

Starting SimpleAtomicLongTest
test worked
Finishing SimpleAtomicLongTest
